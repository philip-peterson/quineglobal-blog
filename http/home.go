			<link>http://blog.quinefoundation.com/post/declarative-stateless</link>
			<description>The QUINE Foundation is strongly in favor of declarative and stateless systems. Recently, we have been battling entropy, specifically the entropy of hosted virtual machines and how their shelf lives are limited.
